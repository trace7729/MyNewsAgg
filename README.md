# MyNewsAgg
UCSD Extension: Android Programming
This mobile application mynewsagg is designed to be deployed to the Zenbo Junior robots in AI_ROBOT Makerspace in STSP, which is a makerspace located at Southern Taiwan Science Park in Tainan, Taiwan.1 The app implements API from newsapi.org, and aggregates news from Google, BBC, BuzzFeed, MTV, BBC Sport, Talk Sport, Medical News Today and National Geographic, and allows user to search key word in multiple news media.2 The app also extends RobotActivity library provided by Asus Developer, incorporating robot features such as speech to text, text to speech and wheel lights. It is an app build to be an app example of Zenbo Junior SDK like those available for download on Asus Developer website, which will all potentially be the reference or lecture material for summer class at AI_ROBOT Makerspace.3 The Makerspace hosts several summer curriculums for Junior and Senior high students, and looks to expand the curriculum that teaches programming in Zenbo Junior SDK. Since Zenbo Junior robot is a relatively new Android device, which was released in May, 2019, it still lacks applications that are specifically designed for its SDK at the time of designing this app, summer of 2020. Therefore, this application mynewsagg is to be deployed to the Zenbo Junior robots, expanding from app examples downloaded from Asus Developer to be the reference material available for summer class attendees.
