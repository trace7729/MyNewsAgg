# MyNewsAgg
UCSD Extension: Android Programming
This mobile application mynewsagg is designed to be deployed to the Zenbo Junior robots in AI_ROBOT Makerspace in STSP, which is a makerspace located at Southern Taiwan Science Park in Tainan, Taiwan.1 The app implements API from newsapi.org, and aggregates news from Google, BBC, BuzzFeed, MTV, BBC Sport, Talk Sport, Medical News Today and National Geographic, and allows user to search key word in multiple news media.2 The app also extends RobotActivity library provided by Asus Developer, incorporating robot features such as speech to text, text to speech and wheel lights. It is an app build to be an app example of Zenbo Junior SDK like those available for download on Asus Developer website, which will all potentially be the reference or lecture material for summer class at AI_ROBOT Makerspace.3 The Makerspace hosts several summer curriculums for Junior and Senior high students, and looks to expand the curriculum that teaches programming in Zenbo Junior SDK. Since Zenbo Junior robot is a relatively new Android device, which was released in May, 2019, it still lacks applications that are specifically designed for its SDK at the time of designing this app, summer of 2020. Therefore, this application mynewsagg is to be deployed to the Zenbo Junior robots, expanding from app examples downloaded from Asus Developer to be the reference material available for summer class attendees.
此安桌應用程式 mynewsagg，佈署至 AI_ROBOT 自造基地內 Zenbo Junior 機器人。該應用程式引用了 newsapi.org 的 API，並彙整了 Google、 BBC、BuzzFeed、MTV、BBC Sport、Talk Sport、Medical News Today 和國家地理等新 聞報導，允許用戶在多種新聞媒體中收尋關鍵字。該應用程式還引用了 Asus 開發者提 供的 RobotActivity 函式庫，使用幾項機器人功能，例如語音到文本、文本到語音和轉 輪 LED 燈控制。充分展現 Zenbo Junior SDK 的應用程式，合併 Asus 開發者開源資源 形成自造基地課程教材，提供給寒暑假機器人體驗課程的學員。由於 Zenbo Junior 機 器人式相對較新的 Android 設備，於 108 年 5 月發布，今年 109 年仍然處於缺少專門 為其 SDK 設計的開源應用程序。因此，該應用程式 mynewsagg 將佈署到現有 Zenbo Junior 機器人上，與 Asus 開發者提的開源應用程式範例成為寒暑假課程教材資源。
